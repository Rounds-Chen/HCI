# Dreamland

[TOC]







## 1. Description

### 1.1 Overview

We use **Unity3D** to develop a 3D interactive system called ***Dreamland*** as our final *Human-Computer Interaction* course project. 

**Unity** is a real-time 3D interactive content creation and operation platform that provides a comprehensive set of software solutions for creating 3D content that can be interacted with in real time.

**Dreamland** is a 3D casual puzzle game. Players can experience the natural gameplay in the game through the simple and fresh painting style. Players need to challenge the steps jumping quickly. In the endless mode, the number of steps and time are infinite, and players can go all the way without mistakes and set off a super storm.

### 1.2 Structure and Modules

We design five kinds of  panel for our project, which are **MainPanel**, **GamePanel**, **GameOverPanel**, **ShopPanel**, **ResetPanel**, **RankPanel**. These panels have corresponding **C# Scripts** for them to realize the interaction.

#### 1.2.1 MainPanel

When our user starts our program, he will first see this panel and can **click** on ‚ñ∂ to start the game.

**Click** on the üîà to turn on or off the game's music and sound effects.

#### 1.2.2 GamePanel

In this panel, user can **use the mouse or keyboard** to control the character to jump steps in different directions,  and the game scene and steps are <u>randomly generated.</u>

<img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/06/21/REGpjI.png" alt="REGpjI.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

#### 1.2.3 GameOverPanel

After the game is over jump to this panel, in which the player can **check** **the score and the number of bonus coins** of this game.

Also, the player can choose to **view the current ranking**, jump to the `MainPanel` or try again.

## 2. Implemented Requirements

### 2.1 Interaction in MainPanel

<img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/06/21/REGzIU.png" alt="REGzIU.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

**Four option buttons and a Game Start button** are in the `MainPanel`:

* **Click** on the role button to <u>access the `ShopPanel`</u>, as described below, where users can purchase and select roles in the scenario.
* **Clicking** on the reset button, a dialogue window will pop up <u>asking the player whether or not to reset</u> the game, and the corresponding action will be taken according to the player's choice.
* **Clicking** the ranking button will bring up <u>the top three scores</u> of the current game.

### 2.2 Interaction in GamePanel

<img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/06/21/REGpjI.png" alt="REGpjI.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

In the `GamePanel`, the player can control the character with <u>the mouse or keyboard.</u>

* **Mouse** Ôºö
  * **Click the left mouse** button to control the character to jump a step to the left.
  * **Click the right mouse** button to control the character to jump a step to the right.
* **Keyboard**Ôºö
  * **Click the keyboard‚¨Ö** button to control the character to jump a step to the left.
  * **Click the keyboard ‚û°** button to control the character to jump a step to the right.

The game is endless mode, in which the player can control the character to continuously jump on the steps, until the character fails to jump on the next higher step or jump on the steps with obstacles before the steps fall, which indicates the game is over.

### 2.3 Interaction in GameOverPanel

<img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/06/21/REJGeP.png" alt="REJGeP.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

If the player's operation inadvertently causes the game to end, it will enter <u>`GameOverPanel`</u>.

* **Information**:

  This panel will show the number of points the player has scored in this round, and the number of rewards earned. If this score is the current maximum score, the word "ÊúÄÈ´òÂàÜ" will also be displayed.

* **Button**:

  There are three options available in this screen.

  * **RankPanel** button: Click on the RankPanel button , it will enter the `RankPanel`, where players can view the top three scores of the current game.
  * **MainPanel** button: click on the MainPanel button at the bottom, it will enter the `MainPanel`.
  * **TryAgain** button: Click on the bottom "ÂÜçËØï‰∏ÄÊ¨°" to restart a new round of the game.

### 2.4 Interaction in ShopPanel

<img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/06/21/REGc2d.png" alt="REGc2d.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

In this panel, players can hold down the left mouse button and drag the screen to view the different characters.

* For roles **already owned**

  Players can click the button at the bottom of the panel to <u>select the character to play.</u>

* For roles **not yet owned**

  The buy button at the bottom of the screen shows the amount of coins needed to <u>buy the character</u>. If the player currently has enough coins, he can click the buy button to buy the character.

### 2.5 Interaction in ResetPanel

<img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/06/21/REG85F.png" alt="REG85F.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

When the player clicks the Reset button in the `MainPanel`, a dialog box will pop up asking the player if he/she confirms to reset the game, and providing "No" and "Yes" buttons.

* **Click** "No" to <u>close the dialog box</u>.
* **Click** "Yes" to <u>reset</u> the game and <u>clear</u> the current game ranking data.

### 2.6 Interaction in RankPanel

<img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/06/21/REGBVK.png" alt="REGBVK.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

**Clicking** on the ranking button in the panel will bring up an information box showing <u>the top three game scores</u> for the current ranking.

**Click** anywhere on the panel again to <u>close the message box.</u>


## 3. Advantages and Disadvantages

### 3.1 Advantages

1. The biggest advantage of our project is that its **interface and UI is fascinating**. We apply some interesting models and randomly generated scenes to make the game look more interesting and attractive.
2. The structure of our program is **concise and organized**, so it is very easy for us to make some improvement.
3. our main interaction **logic is unified,** allowing users to understand and master the functions that can be realized simply and clearly.
4. **The event distribution mechanism** is used to uncouple, making it easier to control events and add subsequent improvements.
5. The game is **simple to operate** and the **interaction is clear and straightforward**.

### 3.2 Disadvantages

1. The game mode is <u>relatively single,</u> currently only has endless mode.

   More complex modes can be added to this, such as a time-limited mode, which counts how many steps the player can control the character to jump over within a certain period of time.

2. The game scene is <u>not beautiful enough.</u>

   Some suitable plot for the game can be added, corresponding to the plot design of different scenes, showing a more colorful and moving visual effects.

3. Our games <u>cannot be adapted for screen resolution</u> and we have n<u>ot been able to port the games to other platforms other than Windows.</u>

4. The <u>game difficulty is relatively simple,</u> players can not choose their own control to adjust the difficulty of the game.

##  4. How to Improve

According to the analysis of our advantages and disadvantages, there are many things we can do to improve our program:

1. We can make full use of the Unity3D engine to **add more features**.
2. It is convenient for us to **port Unity3D to other platforms**, so we could try this after we finish our projects. 
3. Develop **more game modes** on the basis of the current game, as well as develop **the game difficulty adjustment mechanism.**

## 5. Development Environment

- **Development Environment:** 

  Win 10 

- **Development Software:**

  1. **Unity3D** 2020.3.21
  2. **Visual Studio 2019** *15.9.28307.665*

- **Development Language:**

  ‚Äã	C#

  


## 6. Game Logic

We have write many scripts which you can see in the *Script* folder of our project. But I only show some of the core scripts here.
### 6.1 EventListener
`EventCenter.cs`

```c#
public class EventCenter
{
    private static Dictionary<EventDefine, Delegate> m_EventTable = new Dictionary<EventDefine, Delegate>();

    private static void OnListenerAdding(EventDefine eventType, Delegate callBack)
    {
        if (!m_EventTable.ContainsKey(eventType))
        {
            m_EventTable.Add(eventType, null);
        }
        Delegate d = m_EventTable[eventType];
        if (d != null && d.GetType() != callBack.GetType())
        {
            throw new Exception(string.Format("Â∞ùËØï‰∏∫‰∫ã‰ª∂{0}Ê∑ªÂä†‰∏çÂêåÁ±ªÂûãÁöÑÂßîÊâòÔºåÂΩìÂâç‰∫ã‰ª∂ÊâÄÂØπÂ∫îÁöÑÂßîÊâòÊòØ{1}ÔºåË¶ÅÊ∑ªÂä†ÁöÑÂßîÊâòÁ±ªÂûã‰∏∫{2}", eventType, d.GetType(), callBack.GetType()));
        }
    }
    //no parameters
    public static void AddListener(EventDefine eventType, CallBack callBack)
    {
        OnListenerAdding(eventType, callBack);
        m_EventTable[eventType] = (CallBack)m_EventTable[eventType] + callBack;
    }
```

### 6.1 Spawn Random Platforms

`PlatformSpawner.cs`

```c#
private void SpawnPlatform()
{
    int ranObstacleDir = Random.Range(0, 2);
    //ÁîüÊàêÂçï‰∏™Âπ≥Âè∞
    if (spawnPlatformCount >= 1)
    {
        SpawnNormalPlatform(ranObstacleDir);
    }
    //ÁîüÊàêÁªÑÂêàÂπ≥Âè∞
    else if (spawnPlatformCount == 0)
    {
        int ran = Random.Range(0, 3);
        //ÁîüÊàêÈÄöÁî®ÁªÑÂêàÂπ≥Âè∞
        if (ran == 0)
        {
            SpawnCommonPlatformGroup(ranObstacleDir);
        }
        //ÁîüÊàê‰∏ªÈ¢òÁªÑÂêàÂπ≥Âè∞
        else if (ran == 1)
        {
            switch (groupType)
            {
                case PlatformGroupType.Grass:
                    SpawnGrassPlatformGroup(ranObstacleDir);
                    break;
                case PlatformGroupType.Winter:
                    SpawnWinterPlatformGroup(ranObstacleDir);
                    break;
                default:
                    break;
            }
        }
        //ÁîüÊàêÈíâÂ≠êÁªÑÂêàÂπ≥Âè∞
        else
        {
            int value = -1;
            if (isLeftSpawn)
            {
                value = 0;//ÁîüÊàêÂè≥ËæπÊñπÂêëÂæóÈíâÂ≠ê
            }
            else
            {
                value = 1;//ÁîüÊàêÂ∑¶ËæπÊñπÂêëÂæóÈíâÂ≠ê
            }
            SpawnSpikePlatform(value);

            isSpawnSpike = true;
            afterSpawnSpikeSpawnCount = 4;
            if (spikeSpawnLeft)//ÈíâÂ≠êÂú®Â∑¶Ëæπ
            {
                spikeDirPlatformPos = new Vector3(platformSpawnPosition.x - 1.65f,
                    platformSpawnPosition.y + vars.nextYPos, 0);
            }
            else
            {
                spikeDirPlatformPos = new Vector3(platformSpawnPosition.x + 1.65f,
                    platformSpawnPosition.y + vars.nextYPos, 0);
            }
        }
    }

    int ranSpawnDiamond = Random.Range(0, 8);
    if (ranSpawnDiamond >= 6 && GameManager.Instance.PlayerIsMove)
    {
        GameObject go = ObjectPool.Instance.GetDiamond();
        go.transform.position = new Vector3(platformSpawnPosition.x,
            platformSpawnPosition.y + 0.5f, 0);
        go.SetActive(true);
    }
    if (isLeftSpawn)//ÂêëÂ∑¶ÁîüÊàê
    {
        platformSpawnPosition = new Vector3(platformSpawnPosition.x - vars.nextXPos,
            platformSpawnPosition.y + vars.nextYPos, 0);
    }
    else//ÂêëÂè≥ÁîüÊàê
    {
        platformSpawnPosition = new Vector3(platformSpawnPosition.x + vars.nextXPos,
